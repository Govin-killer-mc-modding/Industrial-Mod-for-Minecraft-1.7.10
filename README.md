### ⚙️ Industrial Mod (Minecraft 1.7.10) (02.02.2026)

A custom industrial mod inspired by classic tech mods. I'm learning Java development by creating a complex production chain.

### ✅ Current progress:
- **Materials:** Industrial ore, blocks, and ingots.
- **Tools:** Industrial hammer (consumes durability when crafting).
- **Resources:** Metal plates (the first step to machines).
- **World:** Ore generation in the depths of the earth.

### 🛠 Today's plans:

- [ ] Final textures for new items.
- [ ] Adding a hammer impact sound.
- [ ] Full localization into Russian and English.
