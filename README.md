### ⚙️ Industrial Mod (Minecraft 1.7.10) (02.02.2024)

A custom industrial mod inspired by classic tech mods. I'm learning Java development by creating a complex production chain.

- **World:** Ore generation in the depths of the earth.

### 🛠 Today's plans:

- [ ] Final textures for new items.
- [ ] Adding a hammer impact sound.
